-- Persistent workspace → monitor mapping — per host (see lua/host.lua).
--
-- Desktop (2 monitors):
--   Main monitor (Samsung):    workspaces 1-10
--   Secondary monitor (ASUS):  workspaces 11-20 (matched by desc: since DP-x ports renumber)
--
-- Laptop (1 panel): everything on eDP-1, workspaces 1-10.
--   The desktop's DP-3/DP-4 rules used to apply here as well. DP-3 and DP-4 are
--   REAL connector names on this laptop (USB-C DP alt mode) that just happen to
--   be disconnected, so the rules were neither matched nor ignored: persistence
--   silently died (ws 10 never existed, strays like 11 and 21 piled onto eDP-1),
--   and scripts/switch-workspace.sh — which derives its base from the lowest
--   workspace id bound to the focused monitor — got a polluted range to work
--   from. Docking a USB-C display would have yanked 1-10 onto it mid-session.
